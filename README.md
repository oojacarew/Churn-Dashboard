# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Telecommunications Company)

### Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecommunications companies, directly impacting revenue and customer lifetime value.
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a telecommunications service provider to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable business recommendations.

Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard to explore how contract type, tenure, payment method, and charges influence customer churn, with the goal of supporting data-driven retention strategies.

### Business Problem

The company observed increasing customer churn, particularly among newer customers and those on flexible contracts.
The key questions addressed in this analysis were:

* Which customer segments are most likely to churn?

* How do pricing and contract types affect churn behavior?

* What role does tenure play in customer retention?

* Which payment methods are associated with higher churn?

### Dataset

* Industry: Telecommunications

* Data Type: Customer subscription and billing data

* Key Features:

* Customer tenure

* Monthly charges

* Total charges

* Contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)

* Payment method

* Churn status

### Tool
Tableau Public – Data visualization & dashboard development

### Dashboard Components & Analysis

#### Churn by Payment Method
* Customers using Electronic Check show significantly higher churn compared to other payment methods.

* More automated or long-term payment methods (e.g., bank transfer, credit card) are associated with lower churn.

Insight: Payment convenience and stability may influence retention.

#### Total Charges vs Monthly Charges
* Customers with high monthly charges and low total charges (newer customers) are more likely to churn.

* Long-term customers accumulate higher total charges and show reduced churn even when monthly charges increase.

Insight: Price sensitivity is highest early in the customer lifecycle.

#### Contract Type vs Churn
* Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rates.

* One-year and two-year contracts show substantially lower churn.

Insight: Contract commitment strongly improves customer retention.

#### Tenure-Based Churn (Tenure Bins)
* Churn is highest in the early tenure stages.

* As tenure increases, churn decreases steadily.

Insight: Customer loyalty strengthens over time; early engagement is critical.

### Key Findings
* Churn is highest among new customers with high monthly charges.

* Month-to-month contracts are a major churn driver.

* Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn, even at higher prices.

* Payment methods requiring frequent manual action correlate with higher churn.

### Business Recommendations
* Introduce introductory pricing or discounts for new customers to reduce early churn.

* Encourage migration from month-to-month contracts to annual or two-year contracts using incentives.

* Promote automated payment methods to improve retention.

* Focus retention campaigns on customers within the first few months of tenure.

### Impact
This dashboard provides stakeholders with:

* Clear visibility into churn drivers

* Actionable insights for pricing and contract strategy

* A data-backed approach to improving customer retention and long-term revenue

# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Telecommunications Company)

### Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecommunications companies, directly impacting revenue and customer lifetime value.
This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a telecommunications service provider to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable business recommendations.

Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard to explore how contract type, tenure, payment method, and charges influence customer churn, with the goal of supporting data-driven retention strategies.
